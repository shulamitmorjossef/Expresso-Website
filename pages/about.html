    <h1>About Expresso</h1>
    <p>Expresso is a unique digital coffee platform born from a blend of technology, a love for espresso, and a desire to bring a premium coffee experience into everyday homes. The site was developed by a team of third - year Software Engineering students as part of a final project in a Project Management course. Our goal wasn’t just to build a functional system - it was to create a meaningful, high - quality product that people would truly enjoy using.</p>
    <p>Whether you're a casual coffee drinker or a true enthusiast, Expresso offers a rich selection of coffee machines, flavorful capsules, milk frothers, and complementary accessories—all carefully selected to deliver a perfect cup, every single time. The site is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience, with intuitive navigation, smart product filtering, a user - friendly cart, and a smooth checkout process.</p>
    <p>Every product featured on Expresso is chosen with attention to quality, comfort, and design. From premium coffee blends and precisely engineered machines to elegant frothers that complete the experience - our aim was to make every cup feel like a café moment at home, with just one click.</p>
    <p>Expresso places technology at the core - both for the end user and site administrators. We developed a dedicated admin panel that enables easy product management, inventory updates, and real - time editing - all in a clean, responsive interface that’s accessible and simple to use.</p>
    <p>Expresso is more than a project - it’s a hands-on journey in system development, product thinking, teamwork, and user experience design. From concept to code, we worked with passion, precision, and a touch of caffeine to create something we’re proud to share.</p>
